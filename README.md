# Notes from DevOpsDays London

I'm mostly a developer but with also a system administration background

I was on lease to the infra team (devops) when the DevOpsDays were happening here in London - I'm such a lucky guy!

So I went there and took ~20 pages of notes (I write in large and leave a lot of white lines)

The following is a raw, unfiltered, report of what happened to me at DevOpsDays London. As a transcript of my notes.

### Talks

#### DevOps For Dinosaurs - Niek Bartholomeus 

https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/devops-for-dinosaurs

* Business asks Dev to be fast in producing the software and asks Ops to be reliable in running that same software. Software delivery does not work.

They want metrics for the company culture to see if DevOps is working

* Organizational Health Index - Expansive
