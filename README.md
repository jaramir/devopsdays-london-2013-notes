# Notes from DevOpsDays London

I'm mostly a developer but with also a system administration past

I was on lease to the infra team (devops) when the DevOpsDays were happening here in London - I'm such a lucky guy!

So I went there and took ~20 pages of notes (I write in large and leave a lot of white)

The following is a raw, unfiltered, report of what happened to me at DevOpsDays London. As a transcript of my notes.
