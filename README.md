# Notes from DevOpsDays London

I'm mostly a developer but with also a system administration background

I was on lease to the infra team (devops) when the DevOpsDays were happening here in London - I'm such a lucky guy!

So I went there and took ~20 pages of notes (I write in large and leave a lot of white lines)

The following is a raw, unfiltered, report of what happened to me at DevOpsDays London. As a transcript of my notes.

http://vimeo.com/62491557

https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/devops-for-dinosaurs

* Business asks Dev to be fast in producing the software and asks Ops to be reliable in running that same software. Software delivery does not work.

* Modern companies are build with automation in mind. It's in their DNA
* Change Management in Traditional Company. CMMI

* Shared purpose
* Motivation
* Collaboration
* Effectiveness
* How to collect the data?
  * Interview

How to apply DevOps even if you are a start-up, without huge cash and not based in Frisco

http://blog.serverdensity.com/growing-an-ops-team-from-1-founder/

* Server Density, we make a dashboard for MongoDB
* Instead of documentation: Failure scenario. Write washing machine style issue resolution guide for your systems
* Every manual process should have a check-list
* Uptime reporting
* Detailed external (and internal) communication in case of outages. Think Heroku status pages
* Simulated outages
* HipChat
* serverdensity.com/dd
* Migrated from Bamboo to Travis to avoid wasting time managing internal services
